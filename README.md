# Brewery-Production_Data-Visualisation

Beer has been one of the preferred beverages over the past decades in the US. Based 
on the Gallup Poll, 2019, beer has been consistently showing greater preference 
than wine and spirits. By reflecting this preference, beer production and distribution 
are essential factors in the US beer industry. The U.S. Department of the Treasury 
(Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau) reports the beer statistics annually. 
This data could be helpful to understand the trends of brewery production over the 
years.
